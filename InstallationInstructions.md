## You need to follow these steps to download and use the application ##

  * Download the jar file from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/chatsysteminsa/)

  * Move the downloaded file to a folder of your choice (knowing that others can send you files which will be stored in that same folder)

  * Make sure [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html) is installed

  * For LINUX users, in the command line :
    * give executable right : chmod u+x ChatSystem1.0.0.jar
    * run the file          : ./ChatSystem1.0.0.jar
  * For Window users : right click the file > Open
